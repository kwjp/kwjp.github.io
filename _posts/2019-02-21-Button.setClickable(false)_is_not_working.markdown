### Q
I have set mButton.setClickable(false); in my code but still this button is invoked by global button.setOnClickListener of my code.


### A
That seems to be by design. This is from the documentation of the View.setOnClickListener method:

Register a callback to be invoked when this view is clicked. If this view is not clickable, it becomes clickable.

using both setClickable and setEnabled worked for me
