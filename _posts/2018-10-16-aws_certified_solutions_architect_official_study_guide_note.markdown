### s3

 - Each Amazon S3 bucket is created in a specific region that you choose.data in an Amazon S3 bucket is stored in that region unless you explicitly copy it to another bucket located in a different region.
 - Every object stored in an S3 bucket is identified by a unique identifier called a key. You can think of the key as a filename. A key can be up to 1024 bytes of Unicode UTF-8 characters,including embedded slashes, backslashes, dots, and dashes.Keys must be unique within a single bucket, but different buckets can contain objects with the same key.
